# CS:GO Time

[Live link][link]

CS:GO Time is a site for the (simulated) betting of in-game items on Counter
Strike: Global Offensive matches through parimutual betting. A new match
everyday starting at 8:00pm.

Features:

* Payout algorithm implements a queue and hash maps to accurately and fairly
distribute items to winning users
* The site takes a 15% rake from the total prize pool using a recursive
algorithm to most closely represent this rake value given a pool of items
with varying prices
* Custom authentication using BCrypt which stores userâ€™s password as a secret
hash

Technologies used to build this application include:

* Rails
* Ember.js
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
